# bucketlist
This is a assignment I created for my web Development internship programme. Using only HTML and CSS, I created an interactive and visually appealing webpage with a navbar that includes a BucketList icon and the heading "My Bucket List." To make the navbar more appealing, I used linear gradient colours. Next, I used bootstrap to add a checkbox with the activity, and the activities are displayed on both sides of the page. Additionally, I have given the Activities text a hover effect. Additionally, I have included social media icons and a copyright mark in the bottom, along with my name and contact information. #Features
